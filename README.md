Because demonstrating Minimax through Tic Tac Toe is too mainstream

Nine Men's Morris is a strategy board game for 2 players (or 1 player against computer) that has its roots in the Roman Empire.

Concepts I want to demonstrate through the game:

    1. Object Oriented Game Programming
    
    2. SVG (and maybe D3.js, but I'm not really a UI guy, so graphics are minimal)
    
    3. Minimax Algorithm
    
    4. JavaScript Concepts & its Optimization
    
    5. Online multiplayer (in future, will include FB login + Node&Express&Mongo on back end)
    
    6. Nine Men's Morris
    
I don't give 2 shits about:

    1. Responsive site design
    
    2. Using game frameworks (I'm not making a full-blown adrenaline-inducing game. I'm just making a piece of software to teach a couple of skills for you to add to your repertoire)

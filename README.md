Because demonstrating Minimax through Tic Tac Toe is too mainstream

NOTE: since this was my first attempt at gaming, pardon the hairballs :-/

Nine Men's Morris is a strategy board game for 2 players (or 1 player against computer) that has its roots in the Roman Empire.

Concepts I want to demonstrate through the game:

    1. Object Oriented Game Programming

    2. SVG (and maybe D3.js, but I'm not really a UI guy, so graphics are minimal)

    3. Minimax Algorithm

    4. JavaScript Concepts & its Optimization

    5. Online multiplayer (in future, will include FB login + Node&Express&Mongo on back end)

    6. Nine Men's Morris

I don't give 2 shits about:

    1. Responsive site design

    2. Using game frameworks (I'm not making a full-blown adrenaline-inducing game. I'm just making a piece of software to teach a couple of skills for you to add to your repertoire)
